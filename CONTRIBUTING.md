# Contributing guidelines

Our team is commited to maintaining consistent, top-quality standards and guidelines that will contribute to our greater platform. We welcome all feedback in order to produce the best possible experience for our users.

Don't hesitate to reach out with questions—we're happy to chat! 

If you're interested in contributing to the Carbon Design System, we have a 5 step process for accepting new patterns. 

### Design contribution process

#### 1. Research
* Review our current components within the [Carbon component library](http://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion) to make sure a pattern doesn't already exist. 
* Ensure your submission follows our [Design principles](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/principles)
* Test your pattern prior to submission—that it should pass basic usability tests. 



#### 2. Submission
Any proposed contributions can be tracked in our
[Carbon Design Kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit). To submit your contribution, open a new issue and add the label **Proposal**. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can read a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/">tutorial</a> to get familiar. 

When you are ready to submit an issue, use the template below. 
<hr>

##### Logistics
* Name (First, Last)
* Service team / product team
* Source files of proposed design and supporting screenshots

##### Proposed Design

* Name of pattern
* Research that supports your pattern
* Demonstrate at least one other use case or scenario for this pattern
* Advantages over alternative patterns
* How the pattern would be implemented within Bluemix's UI
* User experience guidelines on proper usage of your pattern (do's and don'ts, best practices)
* Development resources are greatly appreciated and welcomed. If your pattern is submitted without any code, please keep in mind it may be delayed from getting released into the Carbon component library.

#### 3. Review & test
The Carbon Design System team will review your submission. 

* **Consistency**: Does the pattern remain consistent with our visual style? 
* **Accessibility**: Is your pattern compliant with accessibility standards?
* **Usability**: Does this pattern work across multiple devices, and consider responsive design? Is the interaction flow clear and well documented? Is this a pattern that is universal, and can be widely adopted?
* **Content**: Clear language, correct grammar, globalization

If the team finds your request sufficient and it follows standards, we will include it the system. 


#### 4. Integration
Your pattern will be integrated into the Carbon Design System and tagged as **Experimental**. During Experimental, our team will be collecting feedback and metrics on your pattern. Additional reviews may be conducted to tweak the pattern as it adapts into Carbon.
