# Bluemix Design Kit

The Bluemix Design Kit is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets (base elements, components, iconography, color palettes, grids, responsive behavior, etc). This document evolves and changes as we collaborate with partners and service teams.


## Version 6.0.0

**Note**: Design Kit has been updated from `1.0.4` to `6.0.0` to match with [Bluemix Components](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components).

See releases for changes:
